	3. First, I want to point out that the work that Jesse Jordan has done
	   is tremendous. He spent his time and energy for the purpose of improving
	   the search engine on his institution. As a current RPI student, this is something
	   that I can be proud of my institution and alumni. Although what RIAA has done to him
	   and what he went through was absurd, it also makes me think why he did not initially
	   state that it is not his responsibilities on his search engine. Google and other 
	   big search engine companies goes around the possible lawsuits because they initially
	   set up their agreements on illegal files being shared through the search engines
	   and restrict them as much as possible. This case reminds me that you can ruin my own
	   life easily no matter what the purpose is about.
