### 2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
	To maintain programming standards, the development communities that freely operate and improve 
	their open source code also stipulate Terms of Use for each of their open source licenses – any 
	failure to comply with their terms will result in the automatic termination of that license. 
	If the license termination is ignored and the developer continues to use the open source code, 
	it becomes copyright infringement and the guilty party may be prosecuted.
	  
### 3. Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license


### 4. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher
	Do you agree with this claim? write two to five sentences.


### 5. Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses tge GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source.
	Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE is enough).

### 6. Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.

### 7. Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good - write 5 to 10 sentences. You may use tldrlegal

### 8. Create a repository and choose a license

### 9. Take 5 projects from Observatory - create a table which project has which license.
