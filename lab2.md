#Lab 1

### 1. Write five sentences about choosing a project to work in this course and who will be users/customers and what license will you choose.
	I have chosen to work for a open source project that is called Weird Side of Youtube. It is a
	project where we supply weird YouTube videos from a database either using an API or a web page
	for entertainment. The users can be anyone whoever will watch the video and developers also can
	be anyone who works on the project. Also, this project uses MIT license because it will allow
	more freedom of usage and modification of the project for anyone who will use or modify it.
	MIT license is one of the simplest license that exists so it will provide more flexable work 
	environment.

### 2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
	To maintain programming standards, the development communities that freely operate and improve 
	their open source code also stipulate Terms of Use for each of their open source licenses – any 
	failure to comply with their terms will result in the automatic termination of that license. 
	If the license termination is ignored and the developer continues to use the open source code, 
	it becomes copyright infringement and the guilty party may be prosecuted.
	  
### 3. Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license
	If you find software that doesn’t have a license, that generally means you have no permission from 
	the creators of the software to use, modify, or share the software. Although a code host such as 
	GitHub may allow you to view and fork the code, this does not imply that you are permitted to 
	use, modify, or share the software for any purpose.

### 4. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher
	I do agree with the claim about the story of Gopher. Gopher project fell victim to forking because
	they splintered into many options instead of settling on one standard appoarch even before they got
	enough support for them. The developers should have released their software to the public early as
	well in order to gain adherents and have them to improve the code. They started project right but
	then made few mistakes which led their project fall.


### 5. Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses tge GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source.
	Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE is enough).
	Android's standard C library, Bionic, was developed by Google specifically for Android, as a derivation of 
	the BSD's standard C library code. Bionic itself has been designed with several major features specific to 
	the Linux kernel. The main benefits of using Bionic instead of the GNU C Library (glibc) or uClibc are its 
	smaller runtime footprint, and optimization for low-frequency CPUs. At the same time, Bionic is licensed 
	under the terms of the BSD licence, which Google finds more suitable for the Android's overall licensing 
	model. Aiming for a different licensing model, toward the end of 2012 Google switched the Bluetooth stack 
	in Android from the GPL-licensed BlueZ to the Apache-licensed BlueDroid

### 6. Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.
	https://github.com/mmetro/WeirdSideofYouTube WeirdSideofYouTube.
	This project will be using MIT License because it will provide wide range of freedom for users to modify
	the project and to use it.

### 7. Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good - write 5 to 10 sentences. You may use tldrlegal
	GPL will be better for a company because of the major change for the embedded market as GPLv3 requires that 
	the user must be able to run the modified versions on the device as long as the device is targeted to consumer. 
	There is no obligation to release the source when the binary is not distributed. For that reason, you can keep 
	your modifications secret until product delivery.
	LGPL should be better for developers because programs linked against a library under the LGPL do not need to be 
	released under the LGPL and can be kept proprietary. 
	And Non-copyleft licenses like Apach/BSD will be better for common good because in contrast to the GNU licences,
	Non-copyleft licenses are very permissive. For example, the BSD basically says "here's the source code, do 
	whatever you want with it, but if you have problems, it's your problem". That means you can take BSD'ed code and turn it 
	into a proprietary application if you so wish

### 8. Create a repository and choose a license

### 9. Take 5 projects from Observatory - create a table which project has which license.
